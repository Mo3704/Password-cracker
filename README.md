Password Cracker (Dictionary & Brute Force Attack) 

This program simulates a password-cracking tool using dictionary attack and brute-force attack.
It provides a GUI where the user enters:
Username
A 5-letter password (a-z , A-Z)
Then, the program tries to crack the password by checking a dictionary file first.
If the dictionary attack fails, it brute-forces all possible 5-letter passwords and displays each attempt in real-time.
